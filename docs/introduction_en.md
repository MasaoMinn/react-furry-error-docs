# react-furry-error

A cute and practical React development error overlay 🐾  
Turn those frustrating error messages into furry character reactions.

---

react-furry-error is a **development error display tool for React projects**.

When your application encounters errors during development, instead of just showing a cold red error page, it will display **React furry character illustrations with different expressions and actions based on error types**, helping you understand the general direction of the problem at first glance.

Of course, cuteness doesn't mean missing information ——  
All **original error information (message, stack, file location) is fully preserved and displayed**.

## What makes this project different?

- 🐾 "Visually categorize" errors
- 🔍 Doesn't swallow any original error information
- ⚙️ Doesn't intrude into React's internal implementation
- 🧩 Works with Vite / Webpack / CRA / Next.js (runtime errors)

The goal of react-furry-error is not to hide errors,  
but to **help you understand errors faster**.
